# n8n Custom Workflow Engine

This is my personal implementation and extension of [n8n](https://n8n.io), an open-source workflow automation tool. The goal of this project is to understand and build my own customizable version of n8n — including workflow creation, node integration, and automation logic — from scratch.

---

## 🚀 Project Purpose

- Build a **workflow automation platform** like n8n.
- Learn how tools like **n8n or n8n alternatives** work internally.
- Eventually develop a **usable automation backend** for personal or public use.
- Keep versioned progress on GitHub as part of my **developer portfolio**.

---

## ✅ Current Progress

### `v1.0.0`
- Set up the basic folder structure
- Verified first working test with minimal code
- Committed and tagged as `v1.0.0`

---

## 🔄 Version 2.0.0

### 🚀 What's New in v2.0.0

This version marks a significant structural and functional upgrade from the initial prototype.

- ✅ Introduced custom workflow execution logic
- 📁 Improved modular folder structure
- 🔌 Added basic node handling system
- 🧪 Local testing done for flow processing
- 🧹 Cleaned up virtual environment tracking (`.venv/` removed from repo)

---

## 📂 Folder Structure (v2.0.0)
/n8n-custom
├── workflows/
├── nodes/
├── engine/
├── package.json
└── README.md

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add a basic **workflow runner**
- Create custom **nodes** with input/output
- Enable **user-defined flows**

---

## 🧠 Vision

- A clean, self-built version of n8n for better learning
- Eventually usable by others as an automation engine
- Lightweight and CLI/API-based to start (no GUI for now)

---

## 🔖 Versioning

This repo uses Git **tags** to manage progress:
- `v1.0.0`: Initial working structure  
- `v2.0.0`:
