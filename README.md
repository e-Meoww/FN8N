# n8n Custom Workflow Engine

This is my personal implementation and extension of [n8n](https://n8n.io), an open-source workflow automation tool. The goal of this project is to understand and build my own customizable version of n8n â€” including workflow creation, node integration, and automation logic â€” from scratch.
