# FN8N Custom Workflow Engine

This is my personal implementation and extension of [n8n](https://n8n.io), an open-source workflow automation tool. The goal of this project is to understand and build my own customizable version of n8n — including workflow creation, node integration, and automation logic — from scratch.

---

## 🚀 Project Purpose

- Build a **workflow automation platform** like n8n.
- Learn how tools like **n8n or n8n alternatives** work internally.
- Eventually develop a **usable automation backend** for personal or public use.
- Keep versioned progress on GitHub as part of my **developer portfolio**.

---

## ✅ Current Progress

## 📌 Version: 2.1.0

### 🔥 New Features in v2.1.0

- 📧 **EmailNode** – Send emails via Gmail SMTP with app password support  
- 🌐 **WebhookTriggerNode** – Trigger workflows using external HTTP POST requests  
- 🔀 **ConditionNode** – Add branching logic in workflows using conditional checks

---


## 📂 Folder Structure (v2.0.0)
/n8n-custom
├── workflows/
├── nodes/
├── engine/
├── package.json
└── README.md

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add a basic **workflow runner**
- Create custom **nodes** with input/output
- Enable **user-defined flows**

---

## 🧠 Vision

- A clean, self-built version of n8n for better learning
- Eventually usable by others as an automation engine
- Lightweight and CLI/API-based to start (no GUI for now)
